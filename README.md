# Armut Association Rule Learning (ARL) Recommender System
Overview
This project develops an Association Rule Learning (ARL) based Recommender System tailored for the Armut platform, aiming to enhance service recommendations through data-driven insights. By leveraging ARL algorithms, this notebook uncovers hidden patterns in user behavior and service usage, facilitating more accurate and personalized recommendations.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
ARL Implementation: Apply Association Rule Learning to find frequent itemsets and generate rules.
Recommendation System: Develop a system that uses generated rules to recommend services.
Analysis and Evaluation: Evaluate the effectiveness of recommendations based on precision and relevance.
